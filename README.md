## 📘 About the Project

This project is designed to help understand employee trends and behaviors through data science. The Jupyter notebook contains a complete workflow from loading the dataset to applying machine learning models for predictive analysis.

Use cases can include:
- Understanding employee attributes
- Identifying patterns in performance or attrition
- Visualizing correlations between different features
